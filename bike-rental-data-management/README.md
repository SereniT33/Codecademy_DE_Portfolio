# Project Description



## Scenario
A bike rental company wants a database for their analysts to understand the effects of weather on bike rentals. This database will contain a year of bike rental data provided by the company as well as the weather data sourced from the airport. As a data engineer, my goal is to clean and validate both data sets, design a relational PostgreSQL database, and develop views for the database to assist the analytics team.
